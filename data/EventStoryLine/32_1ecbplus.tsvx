John Jenkin, 23, was arrested near the terraced house where Alice McMeekin, 58, and Katie Jenkin, 20, and a dead dog, thought to be the family's pet collie, were discovered. Police were called by neighbours at breakfast time on Saturday after they heard piercing screams coming from the house. One said:"I heard screaming, really high-pitched screams in the early hours. Then later I heard more screaming. It sounded like someone telling a dog to shut up. " Alice lived in the pebble-dashed terrace in Millom, Cumbria, with ï¿½unemployed John. The neighbour described him as a goth and he is said to have recently been in hospital. Katie was visiting her mum from Cardiff, where she was at university. A close friend of the dead mum said:"I can't believe it. They all looked after each other after Alice separated from her husband in the 1990s. We were so close that Katie thought of my mum as a second mum. "John was a good kid, never one of those to get into trouble. He idolised his mum and his sister. His little sister was his world, and his mum was too. " Alice was brought up in Millom, where her father ran a greengrocer's and a fish shop. She returned to her home town 12 weeks ago after a four year spell living in Cardiff. Friends noticed she had lost weight and looked frail. It is thought she may have been suffering from cancer. Another neighbour added:"She went down to Wales to give her kids a better life. Katie got into Cardiff University, I think, and John was at college doing something in special effects. "When Alice came home, John came with her. As far as I know he didn't have a girlfriend. Katie still lived in Wales and had been going out with her boyfriend for two years. "She came up for the weekend on Friday. Alice met her at the station. " Security worker Alice had recently been upset by the death of one of her four cats and had taken in a collie dog called Fenn. The friend said she was "bubbly" when she saw her on Friday. She added:"We were chatting for about half an hour. She told me Katie was coming and she was so looking forward to it. " Cumbria Police have not disclosed how Alice and Katie died. A police spokesman said:"We do not suspect anyone else to be involved. " Detective Chief Inspector Paul Duhig said:"Events such as these are rare in Cumbria. We are doing all we can to bring the offender to justice. "
