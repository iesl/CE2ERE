PUBLISHED:MONDAY, MARCH 11, 2013, 10:34 PM UPDATED:TUESDAY, MARCH 12, 2013, 9:36 AM Anger over the death of a Brooklyn teenager shot and killed by police fueled a riot on the streets of East Flatbush Monday — projectiles were hurled at cops, car windows were smashed and a pharmacy customer had a bottle bashed over his head. The scenes of violence on blocks near the NYPD's 67th Precinct stationhouse followed a protest march that grew out of a candlelight vigil for Kimani ( Kiki ) Gray, 16, killed by police bullets on Saturday. In the aftermath of the riot, as police were trying to secure the area and assess damage to stores along streets strewn with broken glass, City Councilman Jumaane Williams called for Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and Mayor Bloomberg to visit the community. " There's a lot of anger here, " said Williams, whose district includes the riot zone. " This isn ' t just from one particular shooting. A whole community has not been heard for far too long. " Kelly visited the precinct stationhouse about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday — more than four hours after the chaos began — but did not speak to reporters. The vigil for Kimani was held at E. 52nd St. and Tilden Ave., the location of the shooting, which has caused tensions to simmer in the community, in part because the boy's family contests police allegations that he was armed with a handgun. Starting at about 8 p.m., nearly 100 people set off from the vigil site to march the more than 20 blocks to the precinct stationhouse, on Snyder Ave. near Nostrand Ave. But the procession, peaceful at first, turned into a wild confrontation between furious marchers and cops after a faction broke off from the group and began to smash car and store windows with rocks and jump on the tops of vehicles, police sources and witnesses said. " I was sitting in my living room, " said Mary John, 43, who witnessed destruction near E. 31st St. and Church Ave. " People were standing up on vehicles. I saw them take garbage from the sidewalk and throw it onto the street. I saw someone take a TV and smash it into my neighbor's car. They were throwing rocks at the cars. " I said, ' Oh my god ! What's going on here ? ' " she continued. " They were calling out, ' Rest in peace, Kiki. ' I was shocked. " Abdoulaye Barry, 24, who works at African Movies, at Church Ave. and E. 31st St., described how rioters tried to storm the business. He said he was outside, saw rioters causing mayhem in the streets, and rushed back to urge his co-workers to lock the store's gates. Rioters rushed the entrance, fighting with workers as they struggled to lock the roll-down gates, he said. The workers succeeded — barely. But they locked themselves into the store from the inside. Firefighters later had to cut the gates to liberate them. " It was like the end of the world, " Barry told the Daily News. " That's the first time something like that had happened here. " At a Rite Aid drug store on Church Ave. near Albany Ave., which had about 60 people inside at the time, at least one rioter physically assaulted a customer — cracking him over the head with a glass bottle. He was rushed to Kings County Hospital and listed in stable condition later, a police spokeswoman said. A manager of the store was also assaulted; he refused medical attention, the spokeswoman said. There were unconfirmed reports the store was looted; the police spokeswoman said only that the cash registers were not robbed. When cops finally managed to block the mob's progress, about a block from the 67th Precinct stationhouse, rioters began pitching glass bottles at police officers as they moved in on the crowd, a police source said. One person threw a garbage can at a cop, the source added. " They ' re acting rowdy and calling us racist, " said a police officer at the scene. As rioters fled into the night and protestors began making their way back toward E. 52nd St., Williams joined the fray and tried to prevent more violence. " The mayor and the [ police ] commissioner should be down here. Right now ! " Williams, a critic of NYPD policy, said before Kelly appeared on the scene. " There's a feeling that they don ' t really care. They are leading and policing for one portion of this city. But they ' re not paying attention to the other parts; they ' re not listening to them. " Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, a Democratic candidate for mayor this year, also came to the area Monday night. " I understand if young people are frustrated, but we have to help them understand the way to deal with it should be a peaceful way, " he said. " They have every right to protest — that's the American way. " Williams said he was not surprised by the riot, only that it hadn ' t happened before. Critics of the NYPD's controversial stop-and-frisk policy argued it leads to distrust of the police by the black community because its members are stopped in such high numbers. " When something happens, we should be able to trust the police and what they say, " Williams said. " Police officers shooting black men, black men shooting black men, it's a problem that needs to be dealt with. If they want to ignore it, it's just going to keep happening. " Following the shooting death of Kimani on Saturday, police officials said he flashed a gun at a pair of plainclothes cops who approached a stoop where he and others were hanging out. Police said a loaded. 38-caliber revolver was recovered at the scene — but family of the slain teen, who was hit multiple times by police bullets, vehemently deny that he was carrying a weapon. Before the riot Monday, a police source told The News that investigators believe Kimani was a member of the Bloods street gang. The source pointed to two YouTube videos, published last year, that featured violence between Bloods and Crips. The source said Kimani appears in both videos, which The News has refrained from publishing due to graphic content. In one video, Kimani is clad in a red Adidas hoodie and goes by the nickname " Shapow, " the source said. He can be seen taunting and hitting a 13-year-old rival on Nostrand Ave. near Glenwood Rd. in Flatbush after the adversary flashed gang signs and said he runs with the Crips. Kimani also swiped a beaded necklace from the Crip and then stomped on it, the video shows, while his friends in the background identified themselves as Bloods. The second video captured an apparent Crips retaliation following the smackdown. A group of self-identified Crips stormed a McDonald's on Utica Ave. and Ave. H in Flatbush after they spotted Kimani and other alleged Bloods inside, according to the video. After a minute of heckling and heated exchanges inside the McDonald's, the Crips retreated outside. They mocked Kimani for refusing to come out into the parking lot.
