According to the California Highway Patrol, defensive tackle Jamal Williams was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving last weekend on a freeway outside downtown. Williams, who was booked into county jail and later released on bail, did give a blood sample for a blood-alcohol test. However the results have not yet been divulged. Just last month, wide receiver Vincent Jackson, who was on probation for a previous DUI arrest, was pulled over for investigation of DUI. That arrest was just five days prior to the team's second-round playoff loss at Pittsburgh. In a statement released by the team, General Manager A. J. Smith noted, "It's disappointing to hear about the issue involving Jamal Williams. We'll continue to monitor the situation and let the legal process run its course. The Chargers have always been leaders and positive contributors to our community. We take our stature in the community very seriously. " While everyone is human, this appears to be yet another case of a professional athlete not using the matter that is provided to all of us between our ears. With more and more professional athletes making news these days, and oftentimes not for the right reasons, it is no wonder many people have trouble relating with the pros. Salaries that the common man generally doesn't see and an attitude of not caring in many cases is just part of the problem. While Williams and Jackson are presumed innocent, hopefully both of them learn a lesson. At the end of the day, their alleged actions not only impact them, but that family of four, the couple out on a date, or the guy returning home from his work shift. When you get behind the wheel of your car drunk, you could ruin more than just your life.
