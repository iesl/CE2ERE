Text	http://sports. espn. go. com/ncaa/news/story ? id=2061565 NCAA:Improper gifts, assistance given to athletes Updated:May 16, 2005, 6:03 PM ET The NCAA notified Ohio State on Monday of nine alleged rules violations, including cash gifts, improper academic assistance and failure of the school and coaches to monitor the men's basketball program. Seven of the violations involved men's basketball, including a school booster allegedly giving cash and academic help to a former player. The others involved a booster allegedly giving $500 to a football player, and an orthodontist providing free and discounted services to five women's basketball players. Ohio State previously said it was looking into many of the alleged violations, including a cash gift to a recruit from former basketball coach Jim O'Brien, who was fired after acknowledging the payment. "The allegations set forth in this report are consistent with what we expected, " Ohio State president Karen Holbrook said at a news conference. The school must respond to the allegations by July 26, and an infractions committee will hold a hearing before determining whether sanctions are warranted, NCAA spokesman Erik Christianson said. Ohio State's athletic department has faced a series of NCAA investigations of its high-profile sports since the football team won the national championship in 2002. In December, the school imposed a one-year postseason tournament ban on its men's basketball team after O'Brien acknowledged he gave about $6, 000 to recruit Alex Radojevic in 1999. O'Brien, fired on June 8, is seeking up to $6 million in a breach-of-contract suit against Ohio State. The NCAA report says O'Brien allegedly gave Radojevic the money through then-assistant coach Paul Biancardi. O'Brien and Biancardi are accused of acting "contrary to principles of ethical conduct" by failing to report their involvement in NCAA rules violations, the report said. "We deny that we engaged in any improper conduct under NCAA bylaws and legislation, " said Biancardi's attorney, James Zeszutek. Biancardi has cooperated fully with NCAA investigators and is barred by the NCAA from publicly discussing the allegations, Zeszutek said. A message seeking comment was left with O'Brien's attorney. Former star running back Maurice Clarett and other former football players have alleged that athletes received money from boosters, got academic credit for work they didn't do and received no-show jobs at high salaries. The only mention of the football program in the NCAA report is an allegation that $500 was given to a football player, whose name was withheld. Last season, quarterback Troy Smith was suspended from the Alamo Bowl for accepting money from a booster. Athletic director Gene Smith, who replaced Andy Geiger a month ago, said the allegations in the NCAA report were less serious than speculation indicated. "What you see before you is what they found in football, " he said, adding he would be surprised if sanctions are imposed against the football team. Clarett was suspended for the 2003 season for lying to investigators during an NCAA probe of allegations that he received improper benefits from a family friend.
