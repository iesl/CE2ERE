Hooded youths hurled petrol bombs at stores and businesses in the Greek capital, setting the bank and two government buildings ablaze. Protesters also tried to storm the Greek Parliament and the rioting spread to Greece's second city, Thessaloniki. Police said at least three people, a man and two women, were killed in the fire-bomb attack. Firefighters said as many as 20 people had been inside the bank. It was unclear if the dead were customers or bank employees. Two buildings, one used by tax officials and another by regional authorities, also caught fire. Greek President Carolos Papoulias condemned the violence, saying the debt-hit country had "reached the edge of the abyss". "Our country has reached the edge of the abyss. It is the responsibility of us all to not take the step into the void. "What is at stake in coming days is to keep social cohesion and social peace. " Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou said the firebombing was a "raw murderous act". Athens underground stations were shuttered and the international airport deserted as tens of thousands of union members rallied on the eve of a vote in parliament on the planned cuts and tax hikes. The general strike was the first major test of the Socialist government's resolve to push through unprecedented measures since agreeing a ����110 billion ( $158 billion ) EU and IMF debt bailout over the weekend. Prime Minister George Papandreou's insistence that the measures are vital for the nation's survival failed to dissuade unions from paralysing public transport, grounding air traffic and preventing ferries from leaving docks. After rallying in two separate demonstrations in central Athens, members of the main unions began converging on parliament, where the Government was preparing for the measures to be voted on Thursday.
