Four men drove a 4x4 through the front window of the store on Rue de Castiglione, before making off with the jewellery and watches. They then set fire to the vehicle before fleeing in another car. Forensic policemen are examining the Casty store in the central first district of the capital, home to numerous jewellery shops. The heist near Place Vendome is the latest to hit France after a spate of high-profile robberies in the southern resort of Cannes. At the end of July, an armed man carried out a robbery at a diamond exhibition at the Carlton Hotel in Cannes, making off with jewellery worth £88m in one of the world's biggest ever heists. And last month thieves made off with £35, 000 of jewellery after cracking two safes at the luxury Grand Hotel du Cap in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, near Nice. In May, thieves stole £910, 000 worth of jewellery from an employee of Swiss firm Chopard that was due to be loaned to film stars during the Cannes Film Festival and a second theft saw a diamond necklace worth £1. 2m stolen. Paris has also been the scene of high-profile robberies. In December 2008, three men emptied almost the entire stock of gems from the Harry Winston jewellery store. Police said they had recovered 80% of the haul in 2009.
