Meanwhile, local Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) who use bandwidth on the SEACOM cable have been scrambling to implement contingency plans to keep their customers connected". According to an MWEB update-"Some more bandwidth was brought online last night [ 10 October 2011 ] bringing us up to 83% of our required capacity. We allowed P2P traffic to run from midnight to 7am, after which it had to give way for critical traffic again. " As MWEB also uses PeerApp's caching solution, it may help serve some P2P traffic without accessing the undersea cable.
