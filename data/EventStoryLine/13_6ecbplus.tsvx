John Owen, the city's public safety director, says dispatchers got a call shortly after 3:30 a.m. Tuesday that the vacated building was on fire. Crews arrived to find flames completely engulfing the structure. Crews from both Palmer Fire and the Mat-Su Central Fire Department responded to the blaze, using at least two ladder trucks as well as "a number" of other apparatus. The fire was extinguished by 7 a.m., after fire crews attacked it from all sides. Owen says the building will likely be a total loss. No one was believed to be inside the building, and the fire marshal had been called to investigate.
