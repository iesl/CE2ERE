FEB. 2, 2009 Chargers defensive lineman Jamal Williams was arrested early Sunday on suspicion of drunken driving after he was speeding down state Route 94, the California Highway Patrol said. Williams, 32, was going west in his 2008 Bentley about 1:30 a.m., CHP Officer Brian Pennings said. He said he did not know how fast Williams was going. A CHP officer pulled Williams over near Home Avenue east of downtown, in the Ridgeview/Webster area. Pennings said Williams gave a blood sample for a blood-alcohol test, but the results are not yet known. Williams was booked into county jail and later was released on bail.
