The shooting happened moments after the employee, Yvonne Hiller, was suspended from her job at Kraft, where she ' d worked for 15 years, the Daily News reports. After being escorted from the snack plant, she re-entered 10 minutes later with a handgun. About 100 people were in the building when she began shooting. Hiller was taken into custody after a standoff with the SWAT team. A Kraft representative confirmed Hiller is now in police custody and that one of the wounded employees is in the hospital. " This is a sad time for the Kraft Foods family, " a statement reads. " We are working closely with the authorities as they investigate this situation, and our facility is closed until further notice. " Unfortunately, the most surprising aspect of this incident is the shooter's gender. Women shooters are rare but may be on the rise. In February, a woman opened fire at the University of Alabama, killing three and injuring several others. Reportedly, she was a professor whose tenure had been denied. Two years ago, a female college student committed a shooting at a Louisiana college.
