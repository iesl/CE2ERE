Jose Luis Orozco showed almost no emotion throughout the three-week trial in which he was convicted of the 2005 murder of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Jerry Ortiz. A rare exception for the 29-year-old Hawaiian Gardens gang member was an occasional smile for his mother when he turned in his chair to glance back at her from time to time. He will be sentenced May 3. When the jury convicted him last month of the deputy's slaying, as well as the attempted murder of another man just a few days prior to the ambush killing of Ortiz, Orozco sat staring straight ahead, unflinching. As Court Clerk Dan Fallon read the jury's sentence shortly before noon Tuesday, several members of the slain lawman's family gasped, clutching one another's hands. At the same time, a small smile spread across Orozco's face and he chuckled. "We understand and we appreciate the gravity of the decision that the jury had to make..., and that it took a lot for them to ( come to that decision ), " Chela Ortiz, the deputy's wife, said afterward. "We appreciate everything they did, we know they were very careful... and gave this a lot of their attention. " Chela Ortiz-who was married three weeks before her husband was murdered-sat with her mother in-law, Rosa Ortiz, and the rest of the family every day of the trial. They were accompanied by dozens of sheriff's deputies and other family friends, including the family's priest. Most days were difficult and filled with tears as they listened to chilling testimony recounting the last few minutes of Ortiz's life and saw, for the first time, the crime scene and autopsy photos. "I think, for all of us, it was kind of reliving the nightmare all over, " Chela Ortiz said. Family members listened to testimony that included the defendant's violent past and the many times he escaped prosecution by using his gang's influence and power to intimidate victims-including two nearly killed when they were shot and stabbed in the back by Orozco, according to prosecutors. Orozco's friends and fellow gang members also recalled his boasting about killing a cop one day. "I just say thank God it is over, " the deputy's mother, Rosa Ortiz, said. "It was too much some days... to me it was too hard. " It took the jury of six men and six women a little more than four hours, spread over two days, to choose death over life in prison without the possibility of parole. It was almost the same amount of time used to come to the guilty verdict on March 20. According to three jurors who spoke briefly outside the courtroom, the decision was a difficult one made slightly easier by the thorough job of the prosecutors and investigators. None of them wanted to be identified because of the gang ties to the case. The physical evidence, which including Orozco's DNA and fingerprints found on the murder weapon, was overwhelming, they said. There were also a number of eye witnesses including two girls who described for the jury how Orozco hid behind their front door and shot the deputy as Ortiz spoke with their mother. Equally as damning, jurors said, was the complete lack of remorse shown by the defendant. He squandered two opportunities to turn his life around, including chances to relocate out of state and away from the gang with his family in Las Vegas and again with a friend and former gang member in Florida, they said. It looked to them as though he preferred the life of a criminal and reveled in the notoriety he earned in the deputy's death. A taped conversation between Orozco and two friends-one a fellow gang member and the other an associate-in a holding cell at the Bellflower Courthouse made it clear to the jury that a life in prison would not diminish his threat to society, they said. In that tape, Orozco is heard talking about destroying evidence and ordering a hit on the two little girls and their mother-the star witnesses in the case. "I had to hear that tape again, " one juror said. "Because if we were going to send him to jail for life, he could run the same business from behind bars, " a second juror added. "This way he can't harm anyone anymore. " Apartment murder Ortiz was assigned to track Orozco down the day before his June 24, 2005 murder. That task stemmed from the June 20, 2005 shooting of a black man who-according to prosecutors-Orozco tried to kill simply because of his race. The 15-year veteran, who learned the day before that he had made the rank of detective, was patrolling in Hawaiian Gardens near 223rd Street when he spotted Orozco and tried to stop him. The gang member took off running with Ortiz behind him, according to court testimony. Ortiz followed Orozco to an apartment complex in the 12500 block of East 223rd Street, to the home of one of Orozco's friends whom the deputy knew from previous altercations, at about 3:30 p.m. What Ortiz didn't know was that Orozco was lurking behind the woman's front door. As Ortiz spoke to her and reholstered his weapon, Orozco steadied his hand while two of the woman's children-girls age 6 and 8-and several of her friends looked on. He fired just one shot from his. 38-caliber revolver, with the slug passing through a crack in the door and hitting the deputy in the side of the head. The 35-year-old newlywed and father to two boys died almost immediately. Tactical decision Stan Perlo, one of two court-appointed defense attorneys assigned to Orozco, said the defendant's lack of support from his family dealt a massive blow to their case. Originally, Orozco's mother was to take the stand to tell her son's story and talk about the many problems he faced growing up, Perlo said. But she became nervous, telling her son the night before she was to testify that she did not want to go through with it, Perlo explained. Orozco agreed not to force his mother to have to take the witness stand, a decision that likely destroyed his chance at any mercy on the part of the jury, he said. "Our problem was we had no one to tell his story, " Perlo said. "We were counting on his mom and... she was too nervous to testify. " Perlo and co-counsel Robin Yanes approached Orozco's case from a somewhat unorthodox position. Rather than argue their client's innocence, they repeatedly referred to their client as the gunman in the presence of the jury and focused on a number of other people they claimed were equally responsible in the crime. It was a tactical decision reached by the two veteran attorneys, both with extensive experience with death penalty cases, and after consultation with their peers, Perlo explained. "We made a lot of decisions that some lawyers would disagree with, " he said. "I would add, personally, a lot of lawyers with a lot less experience. " Long process When Orozco returns to court on May 3, Perlo and Yanes will argue for a mistrial and, if that is rejected, will ask Judge Philip Hickok to modify the jury's verdict and consider life without parole. The chance either argument will be successful is slight, Perlo said. But that then sets into motion the automatic appeals process, something that will be handled by a different set of attorneys. During that time, Orozco will not be housed with the general population, he will have a cell all his own giving him isolation from much of the gang violence in the state's prisons. At the very least, Perlo estimated the appeals process will last five years. It could run into 20 years because there are both state and federal requirements that must be met, he added. A large part of the problem stems from finding lawyers who are available for such a lengthy commitment of time, who are willing to take on a stressful job and who are qualified, Perlo said. "The decision today made the family happy, but unfortunately it's a false happiness, " Perlo said after court Tuesday. "I've dealt with issues of death for many years... the death penalty rarely offers... closure. " The Ortiz family, however, disagreed. "I'm kind of relieved that it's over, " said 17-year-old Jeremy Ortiz, one of the deputy's sons from a previous marriage. "I'm happy with the verdict, we just have to wait it out now. " Prior to the reading of the verdict, the deputy's family and friends waited in a courtroom filled to capacity but so quiet one could could hear the slight squeaks of the attorneys' leather chairs. Some bowed their heads and rubbed their faces, while others clasped their hands as though in prayer. When the sentence was finally announced a collective gasp for air was followed by cries and sobs as relatives sitting behind the family leaned forward to rub their shoulders and give a comforting squeeze. Outside the courtroom, Rosa Ortiz took out a button with a laminated picture of her slain son in uniform and handed it to the eldest of her five children, Art Ortiz, so that he could pin it on her blouse. Once it was secure she kissed it tenderly. For many minutes afterward, relatives and friends stood outside the courtroom hugging and crying. Detective Dawn Retzlaff, one of the two lead homicide detectives on the case, said authorities were grateful for the jury's thorough and careful review of the facts and investigators were happy with the verdict, calling it just. Speaking on behalf of the Sheriff's Department, Retzlaff added that they wanted to express their condolences to Ortiz's family in what was a devastating time. "It's not a happy day for anybody, " said Deputy District Attorney Lowell Anger, who prosecuted the case along with fellow DA Phillip Stirling. Anger said that the message sent by the jury's sentence-that killing a police officer and flaunting all respect for authority and for life will not be tolerated-was clear. It was the constant support from Anger, Stirling and the District Attorney's office, from the Sheriff's Department and other law enforcement agencies, and from the family's large circle of friends that made the tumultuous trial more bearable, Chela and her in-laws insisted. "We could never repay them for all the support and love they have for this family, and that they have for Jerry, " Chela said.
