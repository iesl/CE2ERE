Judge Philip Hickok told a packed courtroom that he weighed all the aggravating factors and mitigating circumstances in the ambush slaying of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Jerry Ortiz in June 2005, and he concluded that the case "absolutely warrants death instead of life without parole. " Orozco was convicted March 20 of first-degree murder for the slaying of Ortiz, a 15-year veteran and member of the anti-gang detail at the Sheriff's Lakewood Station. A jury recommended on April 3 that Orozco be executed. Wearing the orange Los Angeles County Jail-issued jumpsuit and with his handcuffed wrists chained to his waist, Orozco smiled as he was led from the courtroom for the last time and turned to make an obscene gesture at a photographer. In denying an automatic motion by the defense to reduce the jury's recommendation from death to life in prison without the possibility of parole, Hickok called the slaying of the newlywed deputy and father of two "a cold-blooded, vicious murder. " `Colossal' factors Hickok said the aggravating factors in the case were "colossal. " He noted the 29-year-old gang member not only killed the deputy while hiding outside of the lawman's view behind a door, Orozco also allegedly tried to kill another man just a few days earlier by shooting that individual in the back twice, and had bragged about killing the officer. He had also boasted prior to Ortiz's killing that he wanted to kill a cop, that he wanted to make a name for his gang, the judge added. "The murder was committed without regard in front of two extremely impressionable and young girls, " Hickok said, referring to the star witnesses in the case, two sisters-8-and 10-year-old girls-who described the shooting for the jury. " ( Orozco ) arranged to have witnesses, including those two very young girls, killed so that they would not testify, " Hickok said. Dozens of deputies-many in uniform-packed the court for Thursday's sentencing, just as they had every day of the trial. In the center of the gallery was the slain deputy's wife, Chela Ortiz, who linked hands with her mother-in-law, Rosa Ortiz, and her husband's siblings. Chela spoke briefly before Hickok made the final ruling, addressing her husband's killer directly as she read from a letter written by her stepson, Jeremy Ortiz, and then made her own statement. "Why did you do it ? Why did you have to stand behind a door like a coward ? " the young widow read from the teen's letter. Chela Ortiz, who married the deputy three weeks before he was murdered, told Orozco in a firm voice, "I want you to know you did not break our family, " as her family began to cry. "Our Jerry is in heaven, we will see him again... his memory will live on, " she said amid the sounds of soft sobs and sniffles. "And you will always be remembered as a coward. " The 35-year-old deputy was killed on June 24, while investigating an attack in which Orozco shot a man in the back while doing yard work at a Hawaiian Gardens home four days earlier. Along with murder, Orozco was convicted of one count of attempted murder involving the earlier shooting and two counts of possession of a firearm by a felon. Jurors also found true the special circumstance allegations of murder of a peace officer, murder while lying in wait and murder to avoid arrest, along with the allegations that he personally discharged a handgun and committed the crimes for the benefit of a criminal street gang. In addition to asking the judge to reduce the sentence Thursday, Orozco's attorneys made a motion for a new trial, arguing that the DA was wrongly allowed to bring in overwhelmingly prejudicial material about Orozco's gang ties. The attorneys also argued that the defense was hamstrung when the judge refused to let them bring in the Rev. Gregory Boyle to testify on his gang experience in the penalty phase of the trial. They said the judge also refused to let them add jury instructions about others who could be guilty of aiding and abetting Orozco. Prosecutors pointed out all those arguments had been made during the guilt or penalty phase of the trial, and the judge had already ruled in the matters. Hickok agreed and denied both motions. `Tragic situation' Outside court, Defense Attorney Stanley Perlo said his client stands little chance at winning an appeal in the state Supreme Court, which he described as "very pro death. " In the Ninth District Court of Appeals, there is a chance they will see that the defense was denied a key witness in the penalty phase of the trial, he said. Neither Perlo nor his co-counsel, Robin Yanes, ever claimed their client's innocence. Their client had committed the crimes, both attorneys said Thursday. Rather, they argued that the defendant's lifetime of gang membership and drug abuse were mitigating factors that could not be ignored and that should have spared him death. They added that many of the people called to testify against their client were equally responsible for the deputy's slaying and yet were not prosecuted. "It's a tragic situation with nothing but a sad ending. What else could it be ? " Yanes said. Asked about the pending appeal, Deputy District Attorney Phil Stirling said such cases can never be predicted, but added that he and Lowell Anger-the lead DA on the case-were confident the conviction and sentence would stand. After the sentencing, Stirling called Orozco a "predator. " "He is a killer. He murdered Deputy Sheriff Jerry Ortiz, in addition to attempting to murder at least three other people that we know of, " Stirling said. Orozco's death sentence will be automatically appealed to the California Supreme Court and he was ordered to be transferred within 10 days from county jail to San Quentin State Prison, where he will await his appeal on death row. "He'll probably live a much longer, healthier life on death row than he would have on the streets, " Perlo said.
