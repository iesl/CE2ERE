At around 4:30 a.m. local time ( 11. 30 p.m. ET ) the thieves rammed an SUV into the front of the Casty store, near the prestigious Place Vendome, a well-known square in the center of the French capital that is home to a number of jewelers and high-end stores. After scooping up jewelry and watches estimated to be worth 2 million euros ( $2. 6 million ) the thieves reversed their car out of the store and set fire to it before making off in another vehicle, Le Monde reported. The raid comes little over a month after a masked bandit made off with an $136M worth of diamonds and jewels from the Carlton Intercontinental Hotel in Cannes on the glamorous French Riviera, in possibly the world's biggest heist. A lone robber entered through a French door at the side of the building on the famed La Croisette seafront, scooped up the loot and then jumped out of another window. Despite a huge police investigation, the audacious culprit remains at large. Thieves also targeted the annual Cannes film festival, stealing almost $2 million of jewelry from the safe in the hotel room of an American jeweler working for Chopard, one of Switzerland's most famous diamond merchants. Days later a $2. 5 million necklace was lifted by a crook at a movie industry party at the even more exclusive resort of Cap d ' Antibes, near the Italian border.
